        Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data
        into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values small-
        er than specified value say pivot based on which the partition is made and another array holds
        values greater than pivot value.

        The quick sort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the resulting two subarray.
        This algorithm is quite efficient for large sized data sets as its average and worst case complexity are
        of O(nlogn) where n are number of items.
